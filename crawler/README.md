There is a warning upon compiling crawler.c relating to casting the pointer from integer of different size on line 40. However, this is just a warning and does not actually effect the abiliy of the code to run. 

All testing must be completed from the main root. 

There are no additional assumptions made for crawler. The crawler implementation matches the requirements of the specs.
